        <p>Network communication began as an idea in the 1960s when the United States government developed ARPANET. This was the first packet-switching network, allowing computers to communicate with each other over far distances. This would be the first step to achieve the Internet.</p>

        <p>During 1995, two university students named Larry Page and Sergey Brin began a project called BackRub. With this, they aimed to create a more efficient way to scour the ever-increasing internet. This project would eventually be renamed “Google” to represent the mathematical term “Googol” to represent the amount of knowledge you can access with their service. Google is now the most visited website in the entire world and is the default search engine for many internet browsers.</p>
