Tell me about your website here.
My website is a brief history on the internet using HTML, CSS along with (minimal) javascript. The content consists of three short paragraphs that highlight some of the key steps of the creation of the internet.
This webpage uses HTML5 to format itself.
The Javascript was mainly taught by Google's Gemini AI. Addeventlistener in the js makes the ball wait for something to happen, basically preparing itself for an action. Mousedown in the js makes the ball wait for the left mouse buttom to go down before acting, basically telling it that once the left mouse button goes down over it, start working. Mousemove in the js makes it so the ball follows the mouses x movements but not the y movements.
The information in the index.html describes three key moments in the internet history that were vital in its success.
Style.css tells the html in the index.html how to present itself, making it more visually appealling to the user. This Improves the users overall experience with my website.
I decided on simple white and grey colours for my web page. This was mainly to make the images and navigation ball to stand out among the background.
Overall my tech assessment was a success as it looked fairly similar to my wireframing formative assessment, giving a brief history of the internet while providing accurate information and pictures.
